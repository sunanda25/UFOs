# UFOs
## Overview
A data journalist, Dana was excited to write an article about UFOâ€™s which she was interested in from her childhood. She wants to display her article on a web page with UFO sightings data in a tabular format and provide filters to refine data. 

Dana has a Javascript filled with UFO sightings containing city, state, country, shape, date, duration, and comments information. She plans to display this data in a tabular format and apply filters for date, city, state, country, and shape. A webpage would be built using HTML and Javascript to display UFO related information along with the table described above.

## Results
After entering the webpage, a client will see a banner with the title and a background image under which UFO sightings information will be displayed. As the client scrolls down, they can see a table with date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments columns for each UFO sighting recorded. Adjacent to the table, a client can see a filter search with 5 different filters to choose from: date, city, state, country, and shape. Upon choosing one or more filters the HTML page will display the data accordingly.

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage design is that the number of search results is not displayed. Below are a few recommendations to improve the webpage:
- The website should be able to fetch data dynamically to display the most up-to-date UFO sightings.
- Certain clients may be interested in UFO sightings that have a significant duration. A filter can be added for the duration. This helps clients to narrow their search based on duration.
- Displaying the number of search results will help clients better interpret their results.
